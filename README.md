# DeepLearning_RNN
This Repo representing another popular neural network,Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are the natural extention of feedforward networks to understanding the input / output relationship between ordered sequences.

There are two folders, 

- one representing a project using tensorflow,keras to implement RNNs. 
- another is build RNNs from scratch, based on matrix operation, and use the autograd Lib.
